## Programming Background

I recently finished working through the basics of TypeScript, and to be honest, it was a bit of a nightmare. My first programming language was Python, like many others, and it was a gentle introduction into programming. I liked how straightforward it was to read and how quickly I could turn ideas into something that works. Afterwards I picked up Java, and although it was stricter with its rules it was my first language where I really delved into object oriented programming.

From there, I moved on to C and C++. These languages felt similar to Java but added more complexity, particularly with pointers, manual memory management, and the occasional segmentation fault. While frustrating at times, I eventually came to enjoy the control they gave me over performance. These days, I primarily code in C and Python, and I’ve grown comfortable balancing Python’s simplicity for quick scripts and C’s low-level precision for projects that need that performance.

## Starting Typescript

When I started learning TypeScript, I immediately noticed how many different ways there are to write the same thing. It was overwhelming and sometimes off-putting. The syntax sometimes looked strange and I had a hard time reading it, especially coming from languages where there’s usually one or two clear ways to do something.

For example, TypeScript offers multiple ways to define types and functions, and it wasn’t always obvious which approach was the best for the situation. I also found myself confused by some of its unique data types. One that stood out was the unknown data type. At first, it seemed unnecessary because my usual approach is to decide on the types I need before I even write variables. Seeing a type that basically says, “I don’t know what this is yet” felt counterintuitive to how I like to program.

## Final Thoughts

That said, I did find some features interesting. One that caught my attention was the readonly keyword. Declaring a variable as readonly is a cool idea. I don’t yet have a clear sense of when I would use this in practice, but I can see how it could help enforce immutability and prevent accidental changes to important values.

Overall, though, I feel like TypeScript introduces too many extra features that might be better left as optional libraries. Because of this, I often found myself struggling to remember what a particular piece of syntax was doing. Compared to Python or C, where the intent of the code is usually clear at first glance, TypeScript sometimes felt more like learning a new set of rules than actually writing code. During my practice WODs I actually spent most of my time trying to search up the correct syntax and fixing those syntax errors.

In the end, I can see how TypeScript might appeal to developers who want JavaScript with more structure and safety. the ability to mix types in return values is also something I think many people like in this language. However, I prefer languages where clarity and consistency comes first.
