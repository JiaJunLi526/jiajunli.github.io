## Programming Background

I just finished working through the very basics of TypeScript, and it was honestly a nightmare. My first programming language was Python, like many other people, but I also learned Java not long after. From there, I moved on to C and C++, which felt very similar to Java aside from pointers and the occasional segmentation fault. Currently, I primarily code in C and Python, and those are the languages I feel the most comfortable with.

## Starting Typescript

When I started learning TypeScript, I immediately noticed how many different ways there are to write the exact same thing. It was overwhelming and, at times, off-putting. The syntax often looks strange and was not always easy to read. Things only became more confusing when I encountered some of the unique data types, such as unknown, which felt unusual to me since I like to approach programming with first determing the data types I need when creating the variables.

## Final Thoughts

That said, I did find a few features interesting. For example, declaring a variable as readonly is a cool idea. I donâ€™t yet have a clear sense of when I would use this in practice, but I can see how it could be useful for enforcing immutability and preventing accidental changes to important values.

Overall, though, I feel like TypeScript adds too many unnecessary features that might be better off as optional libraries. Because of this, I often found myself struggling to remember what a particular piece of syntax was actually doing. For me, it made TypeScript harder to read and less enjoyable to use.
