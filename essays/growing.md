I tend to start a lot of new interests, whether they are different types of games or new sources of inspiration. Many of these fade away early on when I hit a roadblock and dont feel like im growing, but a few manage to take root and grow into something more meaningful. One of these is software engineering, which kept gaining momentum through YouTube, where I saw creators combine imagination and programming to build exciting and entertaining projects.

I don’t yet know exactly where this path will lead, but right now I’m branching out and experimenting with different ideas. Each small project or concept I try adds a little more to my foundational roots, even if some of them don’t last. The process of trying, failing, and learning still gives me the experience and motivation I need to keep moving forward.

This is still just the beginning, like a sprout pushing above the soil. With time, effort, and curiosity, I believe it can grow into something stronger that provides both fulfillment and new opportunities. For now, I’m focused on nurturing that growth and seeing where it leads.
